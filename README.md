# Angular Fundamentals

In this Section we are going to learn angular fundamaintals which will help us to learn angular.

<b>Component:</b> Components are like the basic building block in an Angular application. Components are defined using the @component decorator. A component has a selector, template, style and other properties, using which it specifies the metadata required to process the component.

<b>Modules</b>: In Angular, a module is a mechanism to group components, directives, pipes and services that are related, in such a way that can be combined with other modules to create an application. An Angular application can be thought of as a puzzle where each piece (or each module) is needed to be able to see the full picture.
